        <p id="poem">My darling Angela,
            <br>
            <br>The moment I heard your voice I knew I found the love of my life
            <br>Your voice is so Angelic and pretty and you have the eyes to match
            <br>I could spend hours with you and do nothing at all
            <br>But I will never get bored of you
            <br>Every moment I spend with you is the best moment of my life
            <br>You mean everything to me and I'm so glad you're in my life
            <br>You are such my sweet pretty girl and the girl I adore
            <br>I love you more with each heartbeat
            <br>My soul craves you more with each second that passes
            <br>I promise that you will always be mine
            <br>And I will always be yours
            <br>I love you so so so much princess
            <br>Happy Valentine's Day!
